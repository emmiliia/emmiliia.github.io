	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Washington University in St. Louis in May of 2013 with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering. I recently completed my M.S. in Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, where I strived to further my knowledge in business strategy, computer science, and systems optimization. I currently work at Capital One as a Sr. Associate where I enjoy creating digital products that merge human-centered design and technical understanding.</p>
