	<p>Emmi-Liia Sjoholm<br>
	Helsinki, Finland</p>
	<p>hello@emmi-liia.com</p>
	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>I'm a Helsinki based journalist and cook book author focusing on gluten free recipes. I wrote a pretty successful blog in Finnish until realised I needed a fresh start. So here you are at my new site that I have programmed and designed myself. I like to call it a love child of a blog and a magazine. A hybrid. Bloggazine. Slow blogging.</p>
	<p>Each issue has its own theme and it consists of recipes, interviews, feature articles and small bites all focused on food culture and a fairly healthy lifestyle. I say fairly because I've tried it all: non-dairy, raw, no refined sugars, no nothing. Gluten free is the only one that really stuck but I still like to experiment. I take the best flavors of each world and mix them together to create something you can have with a green smoothie or a whiskey sour. The choice is yours.</p>
	<p>I've taken photographs since I was a teenager. I got into digital photography quite late because I loved film so much. I spent most of high school in a dark room.</p>
	<p>These days I sit on my computer far too often. When I don't, I dance ballet, cook and listen to my favorite songs on repeat.</p>
	<p>A warm welcome!</p>
