			<p>Some of the larges courtyards in Finland can be found in Helsinki’s charming Vallila district. I’m meeting a 29-year-old actress Pia Andersson in one of them. The doors that lead to the different staircases are marked with letters from A all the way to H.</p>
			<p>Pia lives in a cozy one bedroom appartment with her photographer boyfriend Ilkka and their Jack Russel Terrier Ismo. The original hard wood floors, wallpapers, vintage furniture and a gas stove give the place a unique look.  Pia has invited me to taste her dessert favorite – pavlova – a meringue treat named after a Russian ballet dancer Anna Pavlova. It seems right since I first met Pia in an adult ballet class.</p>
			<p>”I started baking pavlova a few years ago. It is my go-to dessert whenever I’m on a celebratory mood. I've made it for an opening night at a theatre and for a birthday bash. Oh and of course at our annual Midsummer parties.”</p>
			<p>Each year the group of friends rent a cabin by a lake or the Baltic sea and get together to celebrate the longest day of the year. They all love to cook so the weekend always turns into a real food fest.</p>
			<p>”There are ten of us but we could easily feed at least 30 guests. Everyone brings something to the table and the dishes are always incredible. I think we want to surprise one another. It has worked really well except for the year when no one brought salt. We’ve always had like five cans of it so everyone just assumed we’d have plenty that time too. We had to season our breakfast eggs with Asian fish sauce,” she laughs and insures it wasn’t all that bad.</p>
			<p>Pia has not always been a great cook. In 2011–2013 she worked at a small town theatre. There were not many restaurants nearby so she started to experiment in the kitchen. Around the same time she sought answers to her continuous stomach aches and problems with her skin. Now she's avoiding gluten.</p>
			<p>Pia has altered the original pavlova recipe a bit. It is naturally gluten-free but she likes to use thick coconut cream for the whipped topping. Her recipe has another twist as well – almond crumbs – which she spreads on the parchment paper before adding the fluffy meringue dough. ”That way the consistency is more cake-like,” she explains.</p>
			<p>Pia also likes to use cane sugar which makes a golden meringue crust. The cake looks kind of vintage – and very appropriate for the scene. We set the table with beautiful mismatched plates Pia has bought from a flea market in Berlin. Next she would love to travel to the US West Coast. She says she's been dreaming of it for quite some time now. Literally.</p>
			<p>"I keep having these dreams that I'm already on the plane but I always wake up before we land. Not a day goes by that I don't think of a road trip in America."</p>
			<p>She would like to visit the desert and take the famous coastal highway from Los Angeles to Seattle. I tell her that there's supposedly a really good gluten-free scene in Portland and we get excited. Maybe we should go together. I need a driver because I don't have a licence. Pia tells me she loves to drive around.</p>
			<p>"I think it's because I'm from a small town. When I was young me and my friends' favorite activity was to drive around the city," she laughs.</p>
			<p>The pavlova is finally ready and Pia is absolutely right. The almond crumbs are an excellent addition to the recipe. Normally I would say pavlova is a summer dessert. But this one tastes like winter.</p>
			<p>While we’re eating Ilkka comeshome from a grocery store. The couple is hosting a party this evening for the same group of friends they spend Midsummers with. He has found a huge jar of saffron for a bargain. Together they get a bit suspicious though. Can it be the real deal? We start googling.</p>
			<p>”Maybe I’ll buy the one we normally use as well. Just in case. We wouldn’t want to ruin the soup on a big night like this.”</p>
			<p>Fortunately there’s nothing a little pavlova couldn’t fix.</p>
