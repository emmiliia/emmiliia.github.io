			<h1>Visuals</h1>
			<p>I’ve been taking photographs since I was a teenager.  Eventually film and dark rooms got replaced by piles of plates, spices and a digital camera. I’ve taken photographs for two of my cook books as well as for my blogs.</p>
			<p>I’ve also worked closely with art directors and professional photographers in different publications.</p>

			<h1>Books</h1>
			<p>Gluten-free and simple – my books offer wholesome cooking ideas. My first book ”Viljaton kattaus” was published in January of 2015 and my second book ”Koko perheen kattaus” a year later. They are both packed with over 90 gluten-free recipes but ”Koko perheen kattaus” is also dairy-free and egg-free and its recipes are made with kids and families in mind. Both books are available in Finnish only.</p>

			<h1>Issue N°2</h1>
			<p>Issue N°2 is an online magazine filled with wholesome culinary creations and kitchen stories. After 3 years of writing my blog Torkkuja ja nokkosia I wanted to create a new site that offers recipes and articles about food and food culture. I’ve designed the site myself and used my html and css skills to bring my desig to life.</p>
